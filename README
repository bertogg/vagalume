Vagalume - A Last.fm client for Gnome and Maemo
-----------------------------------------------

Vagalume is a Last.fm client based on Gnome, and specially designed to
work in the Maemo platform.

It has been tested on a desktop PC with a Debian GNU/Linux system and
in a Nokia N800 running Internet Tablet OS 2007, but it should work in
any other Unix-like system that meets the following requirements:

   * GStreamer 0.10
   * GTK+ 2
   * Gnome libxml2
   * libcurl

This program is still in early development, but I consider it
reasonably usable and stable.

It currently has the following features:

   * It plays Last.fm streams using the Last.fm protocol v1.2
   * It can play any Last.fm radio: personal, neighbours, loved
     tracks, or any other arbitrary URL.
   * It implements the Audioscrobbler Realtime Submission Protocol
     v1.2, specifically:
      * Now Playing information
      * Scrobbling of tracks that you listen
      * Love/Ban ratings
   * Ability to tag artists, tracks and albums
