The easiest way to install Vagalume is to create a Debian
package. There are several ways to do it:

   * If compiling for a PC or for a Nokia Internet Tablet, just run:

     ./build-package.sh

   * Alternatively, you can run

     fakeroot debian/rules binary DEB_TARGET_PLATFORM=myplatform

     Where 'myplatform' is one of:

     - gnome: A standard PC with the Gnome desktop
     - maemo: A Nokia Internet Tablet
     - moblin: A Moblin-based device with a resolution of 1024x600
     - moblin2: A Moblin-based device with a resolution of 800x480

If you prefer to compile it by hand or if you're compiling it in a
non-Debian system then run:

./configure && make

In both cases the system should detect automatically if it's compiling
for Maemo or for a standard computer. Type './configure --help' to see
a list of configuration options. For Moblin you have to specify the
platform name by hand (either 'moblin' or 'moblin2', see above).

For rpm-based systems a vagalume.spec file is provided, thanks to
the kind contribution of Tim Wegener. This file is known to work
in the Fedora distribution.
