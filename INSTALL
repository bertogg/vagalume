The easiest way to install Vagalume is to create a Debian package. A
script to generate one is provided, just run

./build-package.sh

If you prefer to compile it by hand or if you're trying to compile it
in other non-Debian system then run:

./configure && make

In both cases the system should detect automatically if it's compiling
for Maemo or for a standard computer.

For rpm-based systems a vagalume.spec file is provided, thanks to
the kind contribution of Tim Wegener. This file is known to work
in the Fedora distribution.
