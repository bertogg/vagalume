I'd like to thank the following people for their help and support
during the development of Vagalume:

* All my colleagues at Igalia, specially:

   - Felipe for his enthusiastic work
   - Mario ("The snake is going to have a shit!")
   - Calvaris ("Wir fahr'n fahr'n fahr'n auf der Autobahn")

* All Vagalume users for their support and new ideas, in particular
  Miia Ranta for creating the Last.fm Vagalume group. Kiitos!

* And, of course, "the friends of the developer":

   - Dani
   - Diego
   - Jesús
   - Manel
   - Marco
